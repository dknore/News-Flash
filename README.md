# Project Name:  News-Flash
Code Fellows 301n9 - Final Project

# Overview
This is a news feed application.  As a user, I want to be able to browse articles from a variety of news sources.  As a user, I also want the ability to filter articles so that I am only viewing my preferred news sources.  As a developer, I want to utilize IIFE's so that all of my function calls are executed on page load. As a developer, I also want to utilize functional programming so that my code makes sense and follows modern practices.

# Architecture
This application uses MVC and SMACS architecture for CSS. The following technologies were used: HTML, CSS, Javascript, JQuery, Node.js, express, pg, fs, bodyparser, and superagent.
